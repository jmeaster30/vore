  Parses out CSV files by matching every line and extracting the values from each element

  Does not handle quoting properly so that will need to be improved but I also want to add other functionality to this first

find all
  line start
  at least 0 (
    maybe ","
    at least 0 (not in ",", "\n") = element
  ) named row
  line end
  "\n" or file end
